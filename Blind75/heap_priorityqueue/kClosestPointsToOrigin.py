973. K Closest Points to Origin (Medium)

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer 'k',
return the 'k' closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)**2 + (y1 - y2)**2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).
