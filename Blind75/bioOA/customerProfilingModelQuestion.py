Customer profiling model

A large retail corporation operating multiple grocery stores provided you with data about their customers.
In this dataset, for each customer, you will find their age, their gender, their current employment status,
the number of visits in a store per year and the number of goods bought over the year (without price or purchase
date information).

Your goal is to crete multiple customers profiles so that the marketing team can optimize their marketing campaigns
and target each profile with a different campaign.

What type of model would you build to achieve this goal?
