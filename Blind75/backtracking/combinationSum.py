39. Combination Sum (medium)

Given an array of distinct integers 'candidates' and a target integer 'target', return a list of all unique combinations
of 'candidates' where the chosen numbers sum to 'target'.

You may return the combinations in any order.

The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times.

Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150
combinations for the given input.

    Solution: Recursion Tree, Depth First Search
    Time complexity: Worst case, tree may be as tall as 'target' (7x1, 7 splits) -> O(2Â°t)
    The same number may be picked multiple times, but all combinations must be unique.
    How to eliminate duplicated combinations?
    Backtracking means adding a number and not adding a number/skipping.
