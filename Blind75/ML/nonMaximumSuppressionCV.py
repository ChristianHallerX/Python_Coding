Implement Non-Maximum Suppression in object detection

NMS filters out multiple detections of the same object, keeping only the most confident one.

ðŸ§  How NMS Works:
1. Sort all detected bounding boxes by their confidence score.
2. Select the box with the highest score and remove it from the list.
3. Compare it with all other boxes:
    - Calculate IoU (Intersection over Union).
    - If IoU > threshold (e.g., 0.5), suppress the box (i.e., it's considered a duplicate).
4. Repeat the process for the next highest-scoring box until none remain.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) sorting, O(nÂ²) comparing each box with each other -> total O(n2)
Space Complexity: O(n)
